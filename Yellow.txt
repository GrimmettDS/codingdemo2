Yellow

The leprechaun 
Did not know what to do
He was feeling blue
He was a shy fellow.

His name was Sam
He loved a girl named June
Like that Adele tune
He called to say "Hello"

Nervous and weak
He asked her on a date
Left the rest to fate
He tried to be mellow

Next day at brunch
Ordered green eggs and ham
Then some toast with jam
And then they shared jell-o

Back at his place
He showed her all his gold
Love for her he told
Then played on his cello

Shows that they loved
They shared throughout the night
House, The Price Is Right,
Abbott and Costello 

They made a cake
With chocolate and soy
Happiness and joy
And topped with marshmallow

Walked down the aisle
Heart beating in his chest
Dressed up in his best
And she was in yellow
